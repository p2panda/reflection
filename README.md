## Development

### Getting Started

The [GNOME Builder IDE](https://builder.readthedocs.io/) is required to build
and run the project. It can be installed with flatpak.

1. [Install flatpak](https://flatpak.org/setup/) for your distribution.
2. Install [Builder](https://flathub.org/apps/org.gnome.Builder) for GNOME:
    `flatpak install flathub org.gnome.Builder`
3. Clone the reflection repo:
    `git clone git@github.com:p2panda/reflection.git && cd reflection`
4. Open the Builder application and navigate to the reflection repo.
   - You may be prompted to install or update the SDK in Builder.
5. Run the project with `Shift+Ctrl+Space` or click the â–º icon (top-middle of
   the Builder appication).

### Multiple Instances

If you need multiple instances of the app on the same computer for testing, you can run GNOME Builder in a separate dbus session:

`dbus-run-session flatpak run org.gnome.Builder`

### Diagnostics

Set the `RUST_LOG` environment variable to your verbosity setting and filter to
enable log-based diagnostics with [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing). Example:
`RUST_LOG=debug` or `RUST_LOG=p2panda_net=INFO` etc.
