  <summary>Take notes collaboratively</summary>
  <description>
    <p>Reflection allows collaborative writing, with a specific focus on taking notes during meetings. Simultaneously contribute to a document from multiple devices at the same time across the internet, or the local network. Then continue working on the same documents later, even if you're fully offline. Your changes will sync up with others seamlessly as soon as you're back online.</p>
    <p>This is possible thanks to a local-first synchronization system built using p2panda and the Loro CRDT library.</p>
    <p>Note: Reflection is still in development, and important features such as end-to-end encryption and access controls are not available in this version yet. Adding these features in the future will be a big structural change to the app, so we can't currently promise that all your documents can be migrated across to these future versions. For now, we recommend backing up documents to local files.</p>
